How would you go about taking this string:

names = "tahngarth,oRim,ERTAI,Karn,mirri,CrOvAx,gerrard"

def capitalize_list(list_of_names):
    return [name.capitalize() for name in list_of_names]

Use .format() to print out x, y, and z to create the sentence below without changing the values of x, y, or z:

string_to_create = "Charlie and Bob went to the park to ride the slides with Alice."

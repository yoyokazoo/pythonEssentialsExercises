What is the difference between an int and a float?
	Integers are exact, whole numbers.  Floats can have decimal places, and are approximations.  Very good ones if you round a bit, but still technically approximations.

What are some of the dangers of using floats?
	Since they are inexact, you can calculate two floats that should equal one another, but are .0000000001 different so == would return False.

What is the difference between & and "and"?
	& is the bitwise-and, "and" is the boolean and.

The following line is run in python "x = 1 + 3" -- what type is x?

What is it called when python forces one number to become the type of another number?

How are tuples declared, and why might you use one?
	(1, 2).  Maybe you're storing a point on a graph (x, y), or a simple data structure ("Hammer", 9.99).  Anything more complicated and you'll probably want a more full featured one.

You have a bunch of filenames and you want to check if they're JPEGs.  Using slicing, how would you go about doing so?
	filename = "bob.jpg"
	filetype = filename[:4]
	if filetype.lower == ".jpg":
		# do some cool stuff with your .jpg
		# don't worry if you didn't convert to lowercase

For extra credit, what is the function in the str library that could help you do this?
	if filename.lower().endswith(".jpg"):
		# party

What is it called when you put a \ in a string to use characters like ' and "?

What are two of the most common byte encodings?

Strings are immutable.  What does that mean?

You have a string, "8.324" -- how would you convert that to a float?
	x = float("8.324")
	This is called "casting" in other languages
